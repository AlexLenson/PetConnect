# Pet Rescue Hub

## Welcome to Our Compassionate Community

Welcome to the Pet Rescue Hub, where compassion meets companionship. Our website is a dedicated platform committed to connecting loving families with adoptable pets in need of a forever home. We believe in the power of adoption and the profound impact it can have on both the lives of animals and their human companions. By choosing to adopt, you not only gain a loyal companion but also contribute to creating a world where every pet has a loving home.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js and Express.js:** We use Node.js as our server-side JavaScript runtime and Express.js as our web application framework to create a robust and efficient RESTful API.

- **Handlebars.js:** As our templating engine, Handlebars.js allows us to dynamically generate HTML content, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.

- **MySQL and Sequelize ORM:** Our choice of database technology is MySQL, and we utilize the Sequelize ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database. This combination ensures a reliable and scalable data storage solution for our pet profiles and user information.

## Folder Structure (MVC Paradigm)

Our application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm to organize and structure the codebase for clarity and maintainability. Here's an overview of our folder structure:

- **models:** Contains database models defined using Sequelize, representing the data structure of our application.

- **views:** Houses Handlebars.js templates responsible for rendering dynamic HTML content.

- **controllers:** Manages the application's business logic, handling user requests and interacting with the models to update the database.

- **public:** Stores static assets such as stylesheets, images, and client-side scripts.

- **routes:** Defines the routes and endpoints of our RESTful API, directing incoming requests to the appropriate controllers.

- **config:** Holds configuration files for database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific settings.
